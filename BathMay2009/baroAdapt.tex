Mesh refinement criteria
\end{center}

\begin{list0}

\item Climate models do not converge with resolution -- instead more features are resolved.

\item So mathematical error estimates may not be optimal refinement criteria

\item Infrequent adaptation:

\begin{list1}

\item Reduce inevitable cost and loss of accuracy associated with adaptation

\item Do not recursively resolve spurious features

\item Do not resolve all fine scales

\end{list1}
\end{list0}

    \item \textcolor{#2}{Calculate a measure of the features which are unresolved on the coarse mesh and represent this on the coarse mesh}
    \item \textcolor{#3}{Simulate the next 12 hours on the coarse mesh advecting the unresolved features}
    \item \textcolor{#4}{Keep track of maximum refinement criteria on the coarse mesh over 12 hours based on resolved and unresolved features}
    \item \textcolor{#5}{Define a new required mesh density function based on coarse mesh refinement criteria over 12 hours}
    \item \textcolor{#6}{Generate a new mesh which satisfies the given mesh density function}
    \item \textcolor{#7}{Map previous latest refined mesh solution onto new mesh}
