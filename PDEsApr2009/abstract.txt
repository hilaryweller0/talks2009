Predicting Mesh Density for Adaptive Modelling of the Global Atmosphere

Hilary Weller, University of Reading, UK

The shallow water equations are solved using a mesh of polygons on the sphere which adapts infrequently to the predicted future solution. Infrequent mesh adaptation reduces the cost of adaptation and load balancing and will thus allow for more accurate mapping on adaptation. Improvements in accuracy are also gained because the mesh is refined before high resolution features develop rather than adapting just after high resolution features begin to develop.

The growth of a barotropically unstable jet is simulated, adapting the mesh every 12 hours. Using an adaptation criterion based largely on the gradient of the vorticity leads to a mesh with around 20% of the cells of a uniform mesh which gives equivalent results. This is a similar proportion to previous studies of the same test case with mesh adaptation every one to twenty minutes.

The prediction of the mesh density involves solving the shallow water equations on a coarse mesh in advance of the locally refined mesh in order to estimate where features requiring higher resolution will grow, decay or move to. The adaptation criterion consists of two parts: that resolved on the coarse mesh and that which is not resolved and so is passively advected on the coarse mesh. This combination leads to a balance between resolving features controlled by the large scale dynamics and maintaining fine scale features.
