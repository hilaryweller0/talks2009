\begin{list0}

    \item Adaptive meshing for improved resolution of important features without the expense of high resolution globally. Features such as:
    \begin{list1}
        \item Tropical cyclones
        \item Extratropical fronts
        \item Deep convection
    \end{list1}

    \item But mesh adaptation is expensive and can introduce errors

    \item So can it be done less frequently?

    \item How to predict in advance where resolution will be needed?

    \item Block structured or gradual Voronoi meshing and refinement

\end{list0}
