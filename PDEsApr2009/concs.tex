\begin{slide}{Conclusions}

\begin{list0}

\item Any mesh irregularity can trigger release of physically unstable flow

\item Mesh adaptation only every 12 hours (72 time steps):

\begin{list1}
\item using coarse prediction of future 12 hours
\item gives accurate results
\item reduces remeshing costs
\item reduces likelihood of runaway adaptation
\end{list1}
\end{list0}

\begin{center}\Large\bfseries Future Work \end{center}

\begin{list0}

\item More work on long range prediction of mesh density requirements

\begin{list2}
    \item eg. where will mesh density be required to resolve convection over the
    next few hours
\end{list2}

\item Conservative mapping

\item Gradual anisotropic refinement of polygons

\item Can vertical adaptation be beneficial?

\end{list0}
