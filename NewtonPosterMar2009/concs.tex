\begin{blist}

    \item At day 6 the adaptive model uses 21\% of the cells of the mesh with uniform resolution as fine as the finest adaptive resolution.

    \item Remeshing every 12 hours (72 time steps) rather than every 1 or 20 minutes (St-Cyr et al, 2008) or every time step (L\"auter et al, 2007).

    \item Power et al (2006) used one adjoint step to estimate where to refine for the following 40 time steps. But non-linear interactions cannot be predicted.

    \item Refined region of mesh does not lag behind regions of intense activity.

    \item Refinements based on $|\nabla\vortDiv|$ more efficient than based on \vortDiv.

    \item Technique could be used with convection parameterisation on coarse mesh to predict where high resolution will be needed to resolve deep convection before it breaks out.
