\heading{Motivation}

\begin{blist}
    \item Adaptive meshing for improved resolution of important features without the expense of high resolution globally. Features such as:
    \begin{plist}{-}
        \item Tropical cyclones
        \item Extratropical fronts
        \item Deep convection
    \end{plist}
    \item But mesh adaptation is expensive and can introduce errors

    \item So can it be done less frequently?

    \item How to predict in advance where resolution will be needed?

\end{blist}
