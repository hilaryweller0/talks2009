{\large\color{purple} Aim}
\begin{list0}
\item Non-hydrostatic, fully elastic model of the atmosphere
\item Using semi-implicit time stepping
\item An unstructured mesh\pause
\end{list0}

{\large\color{purple} Optimal Solution on a Structured Grid}
\begin{list0}
\item C-grid staggering in the horizontal (to prevent $p-\vec{U}$ oscillations)
\item Charney-Phillips staggering in the vertical (to prevent $p-T$ oscillations)
\item Thermodynamic variables -- $\Pi - \theta$
$\biggl(\Pi = \bigl(\frac{p}{p_0}\bigr)^\kappa$,
$\theta = T\bigl(\frac{p_0}{p}\bigr)^\kappa\biggl)$\pause
\end{list0}

{\large\color{purple} Problems on an Unstructured Grid}

Cannot have all 3 of:
\begin{list0}
\item Fully staggered
\item Accuracy $\ge 2^{nd}$ order
\item Exact conservation of mass and energy
\end{list0}

{\large\color{purple} So Why go Unstructured}
\begin{list0}
\item These disadvantages hold for any kind of unstructuredness, even nested grids
\item Need some form of unstructuredness to local refinement\pause
\end{list0}

{\large\color{purple} AtmosFOAM Solution:}
\begin{list0}
\item Blending between staggered and co-located algorithms
\item Thermodynamic variables $p$ and $\theta$
\end{list0}
Upshot:
\begin{list0}
\item Grid scale oscillations suppressed
\item Good conservation (mass exact)
\item Accuracy $\ge 2^{nd}$ order
\end{list0}
