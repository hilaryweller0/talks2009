\begin{slide}{Conclusions}

\begin{list0}

\item Co-located algorithm suitable for an unstructured mesh can give good results for non-hydrostatic mountain waves

\item Mesh refinement patterns alter these waves

\item No wave speed time step restrictions (since semi-implicit)

\end{list0}

\begin{center}\Large\bfseries Further Work \end{center}

\begin{list0}

\item Filter small scale waves before they pass from fine to coarse mesh

\item Improve interpolation from faces to cell centres (currently 1st order)

\end{list0}
